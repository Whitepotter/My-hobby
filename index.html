        <p> My favourite hobby is reading books as I love escaping into a whole new world where there's magic or talking monkeys. I also love reading as I can imagine Harry Potter riding a broomstick or Bilbo Baggins meeting with Smaug the dragon in my minds eye, as the words paint a picture in my head.</p>
